# Code-Refactor-Homework
<!--I restructured the semantics of the HTML, using the updated tags in use with HTML 5. The specific notes are annotated inside the index.html document. 

1) I added "alt=" extensions for the images. 

2) I renamed the "benefits" to "sidebar". I renamed the article classes to match with the headers.

3) I restructured the style.css file, putting it into the semantic order of the index.html.

4) I renamed a few elements to fit the the html classes.
